# ================================ 
# 
# ATTENTION: There is only very basic sanity checking on the configuration. 
# That means you can set your temperature limits as insane as you like. You 
# can do anything stupid, e.g. turn off your fan when your CPU reaches 70Â°C. 
# 
# That's why this program is called THINKfan: You gotta think for yourself.

# ==================================================== 
# 
# IMPORTANT: 
# 
# To keep your HD from overheating, you have to specify a correction value for 
# the sensor that has the HD's temperature. You need to do this because 
# thinkfan uses only the highest temperature it can find in the system, and 
# that'll most likely never be your HD, as most HDs are already out of spec 
# when they reach 55 Â°C. 
# Correction values are applied from left to right in the same order as the 
# temperatures are read from the file. 
# 
# For example: 
# sensor /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal (0, 0, 10) 
# will add a fixed value of 10 Â°C the 3rd value read from that file. Check out 
# http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Thermal_Sensors to find out how much you may 
# want to add to certain temperatures. 

#  Syntax: 
#  (LEVEL, LOW, HIGH) 
#  LEVEL is the fan level to use (0-7 with thinkpad_acpi) 
#  LOW is the temperature at which to step down to the previous level 
#  HIGH is the temperature at which to step up to the next level 
#  All numbers are integers.
