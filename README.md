# dotfiles
Dotfiles for my i3 Arch setup.

## Vim
I use [local vimrc files](https://github.com/LucHermitte/local_vimrc) in order to have distinct vim environments on a project-to-project basis (writing, python, node...). They each use a [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) theme.

## Zsh
I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with the agnoster theme.
